Todo list:

1. Crop selection model has a bug (or a feature?). The success_adjustment method reduces the probability of planting a crop you failed at by three times more than it increases the probability of planting a crop you succeeded at. This is just how the probability redistribution works. If we don't like it, we need to split the Decision up into two parts, success_adjustment and failure_adjustment, and give the influences different rates.

2. kwargs and args between Decisions/Influences not good

3. Clamping should be temporary.

4. Crop maturity, labor and harvester availability, birds and rains should all be at least semi-realistic -- reading project for someone in Mihai's group?

5. If we have real marketplace data, it needs to be added to the map and an Influence needs to be added to crop selection.

6. The map and plotting slow things down very badly.

7. One last rule from ZST (gendered follow the leader) but I won't add it with the for loops.

8. Test crop selection rules against data from Dr. Fall.
