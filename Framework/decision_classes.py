class Decision ():
    '''
    A decision space for an individual is represented as a multinomial distribution
    over c options.  For example, [.1,.3,.25,.35] is a distribution over c = 4 
    options. Equivalently, a decision space for an individual is a point in c-space,
    which we'll call a decision point.  Deliberating a decision involves iteratively 
    adjusting decision probabilities, or, equivalently, moving a decision point. 
    This is done by the Influence class.  
    
    The decision spaces of a cohort of r individuals is represented as an array 
    called probs which has shape r,c.  The initial value of probs is init_probs. 
    
    probs can be masked and masked values can be clamped.  For efficiency and 
    understandability, masking is limited to entire columns.  (In theory probs 
    could have a 2D mask, but this would require reimplementing more of the 
    functionality of numpy masked arrays or using the ma package, which is an 
    order of magnitude slower than what's here.)  
    
    `mask` should be a boolean vector of length c, where True means masked and 
    False means unmasked (the convention of the ma package).
    
    If masked vals is None, then the masked values are untouched, but sometimes
    we want to clamp the masked values; for example, we might want them to be 
    very small probabilities. In this case, masked_vals should be a vector of
    length c or broadcastable to a vector of length c.
    
    Currently you cannot clamp unmasked values. That is, clamping means, "set the
    values and don't allow them to change."
    
    Influences needs to know the mask and clamped values to ensure that decision
    points remain in the probability simplex.  Influences inherit masks and 
    clamped values from Decisions. 
    
    If copy_probs = True, then self.probs is a copy of init_probs, otherwise 
    changes are made to init_probs.
    
    *args and **kwargs are passed on to Influences.  For example, cohorts or
    populations might be passed.

class Influence () :
    ''' p1 is a 2D array of shape r,c where each row is a multinomial over
    c classes. Rows p1 in are points in a probability simplex.  The `fun` argument 
    is bound to a function that returns 'destination' points, called p0. Points 
    in p0 are multinomials with c classes. `fun` returns either one point (i.e.,
    a vector of length c) or r points (i.e., an array of the same shape as p0).
    Influences move p1 toward p0 at a specified rate.  The `move_p1` method 
    ensures that all points in p1 remain in the probability simplex.
    
    Influences get most of their parameters from the Decision objects that they
    influence.  This ensures that Influences inherit masking and clamping from
    Decisions, which is necessary if masking or clamping change during a 
    decision problem.  However, it requires a one-to-one correspondence between 
    Decision objects and Influence objects; you can't 'reuse' an influence in 
    another decision, you have to create a new influence object for each decision.
    In practice, this is easy because creating an influence object requires few 
    parameters, and can be done by calling the `make_influence` method of a 
    Decision object.
